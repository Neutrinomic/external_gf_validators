# External generic function validators

Their purpose is to help proposal voters to validate the payloads, by rendering human-readable text that gets included inside proposal body.
The functions can also validate if message parameters are correct.

Validators for generic functions calling Neutrinite DAO controlled dapps will not be here, but inside the dapp canisters.
